## Feature 1: Snap to Line of Scrimmage (LOS)

### Description
The "Snap to LOS" feature automatically aligns offensive players to their proper positions relative to the Line of Scrimmage with a single click.

### How It Works
- **Button Location**: Located in the toolbar next to "Mirror L/R" and "Flip Field" buttons
- **Functionality**:
  - Automatically positions offensive linemen (LT, LG, C, RG, RT) at y=300 (the LOS)
  - Positions the QB 40 pixels behind the line (y=340)
  - Maintains all x-positions (horizontal spacing)
  - Applies snap-to-grid for clean alignment
  - Works across all slides simultaneously

### Usage
1. Click the "Snap to LOS" button in the play editor
2. All offensive line players will align to the LOS
3. The QB will be positioned appropriately behind the center
4. Changes are automatically saved to Firestore

### Technical Implementation
- Function: `snapToLOS()` in `src/lib/formations.ts`
- Integration: Play editor at `src/pages/play/[id].tsx`
